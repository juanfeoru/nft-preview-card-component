## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me practice **positioning elements with Flexbox**, using **CSS Grid for layout**, and handling **hover effects without affecting nested elements like SVGs**.

One of the things Iâ€™m proud of is handling the hover overlay effect on the image:

```css
.card-image::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background-color: rgba(0, 255, 247, 0.5);
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
}

.card-image:hover::before {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to keep improving my CSS animations and transitions for smoother hover states, as well as deepening my understanding of responsive design using both Flexbox and Grid.
